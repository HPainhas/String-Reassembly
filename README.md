# String-Reassembly
Given a file name (relative to the path where the application is running) that contains fragments of a single original source text, one fragment per line, outputs to stdout the result of trying to reassemble the original text from those fragments using a "greedy assembler". The result, if reassembly is complete, might be the original text; but this might not happen because a greedy assembler can make a mistake and end up predicting the fragments were from a string other than the true original source text. It can also end up with two or more fragments that are mutually non-overlapping, in which case it outputs the remaining fragments, appropriately labelled.
